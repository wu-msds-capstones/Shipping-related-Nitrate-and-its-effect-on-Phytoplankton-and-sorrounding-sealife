To assess whether regional patterns exist in ocean nitrate levels and human activity, we first applied K-means clustering to the dataset. Based on the Elbow Method (see Figure 1), we selected four clusters that best captured variance in shipping density, nitrate concentrations, and distance from shore. When mapped spatially (see Figure 2), these clusters aligned with recognizable oceanographic patterns: Cluster 1 concentrated along dense shipping lanes in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean, Cluster 3 near highly trafficked coasts, Cluster 2 in less-trafficked open ocean, and Cluster 0 spread broadly across lower-traffic southern regions.
