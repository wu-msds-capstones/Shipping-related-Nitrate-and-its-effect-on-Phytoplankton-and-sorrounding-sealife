To assess whether regional patterns exist in ocean nitrate levels and human activity, we first applied K-means clustering to the dataset. Based on the Elbow Method (see Figure 1), we selected four clusters that best captured variance in shipping density, nitrate concentrations, and distance from shore. When mapped spatially (see Figure 2), these clusters aligned with recognizable oceanographic patterns: Cluster 1 concentrated along dense shipping lanes in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean, Cluster 3 near highly trafficked coasts, Cluster 2 in less-trafficked open ocean, and Cluster 0 spread broadly across lower-traffic southern regions.

To test whether shipping density categories are independent of nitrate concentration, we used a chi-square test on the contingency table of shipping and nitrate categories. The result showed a highly significant association:

$$
\text{Chi-square Statistic}: 212.997  
p-\text{value}: 5.60 \times 10^{-47} 
\text{Degrees of Freedom}: 2
$$

This means that areas with higher shipping density are significantly more likely to fall into higher nitrate categories, suggesting a non-random relationship between human maritime activity and nutrient levels in surrounding waters.

To directly measure the relationship between shipping activity and nitrate concentration, we ran a log-log regression using Atlantic Ocean data. Both nitrate values and shipping densities were log-transformed to reduce skew and better meet linearity assumptions. The results were statistically significant:

$$
log(\text{nitrate}) = 1.97 + 0.019 \times log(\text{shipping})  
R^2 = 0.078, p < 0.001
$$

While this is statistically significant with a $p$-value less than 0.05, the $R^2$ indicates that very little of the variability in nitrate concentration is caused by shipping. These effects are consistent and regions with higher shipping do tend to have higher levels of nitrate. In (Figure 3) we plot the regression model to find:

To test whether nitrate levels differ meaningfully across the environmental clusters we identified, we used a one-way ANOVA. This method evaluates whether the mean nitrate concentration is equal across the four cluster groups. We restricted the analysis to points located in the Atlantic Ocean region and filtered for rows with valid nitrate and cluster values. This test yielded a very large $F$-statistic (38344.40) and a $p$-value effectively equal to zero, strongly indicating that average nitrate levels vary significantly across clusters:

ANOVA Results (nitrate_value $\sim$ cluster):
$F$ statistic: 38344.3988
$p$-value: 0.0000e+00

Cluster 0: 12,866 observations  
Cluster 1:  1,286 observations  
Cluster 2: 12,802 observations  
Cluster 3:  9,362 observations  

These results confirm that the clustering process successfully captured distinct nitrate regions. The high between-group variance relative to within-group variance suggests the clusters represent some change caused by humans.
