# Abstract

This study examines how major shipping lanes affect the level of nitrate in the water and the effect this has on the phytoplankton levels in the surrounding area. We used data joined by longitude and latitude between the World Ocean Database and shipping density information from the World Bank Group to analyze the relationship between nitrate released from ships and the levels of phytoplankton in the surrounding ocean. We use statistical methods to show whether areas with higher shipping density are significantly different from areas with lower shipping density. In doing this we found a correlation between the shipping density and increased nitrate, and chlorophyll which often correlate to an increase in the phytoplankton in the area. These findings suggest that international shipping may be altering ocean chemistry in ways that impact primary producers, highlighting the need for greater attention to the ecological effects of global trade routes.
