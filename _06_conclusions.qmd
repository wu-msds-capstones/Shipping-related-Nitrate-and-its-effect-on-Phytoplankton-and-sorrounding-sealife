# Discussion

While much of the results above suggested statistical significance, it is hard to say with certainty whether these results are true, or if they are a product of the variables analyzed. The ocean is a complex system full of moving parts, and many additional variables that were not included have the potential to affect the results of our analysis. Ocean currents, global and local weather patterns, and the lack of uniformity in the chemical composition of the water can affect how and where the NOX emissions come into contact and dissolve into the oceans and also the level and type of plankton found. The human effect is also complex, and distilling such an effect down to shipping density and distance from the coastline may be a gross oversimplification. While international shipping accounts for a sizable amount of NOX emissions into the atmosphere, it is not the only source. One key limitation of this study is the mismatch between the temporal and spatial resolution of our datasets. Shipping density was derived from aggregated raster imagery, while nitrate measurements are point-based and vary by collection date and depth, which may obscure short-term or fine-scale effects. Additionally, regression results showed low explanatory power, indicating that other factors such as ocean currents, natural upwelling, or atmospheric deposition likely play major roles in nitrate variability. Finally, data gaps particularly in polar regions and in areas with sparse in-situ sampling limit the global generalizability of our findings.

# Conclusion

In this study we provide evidence that international shipping activity is associated with elevated nitrate levels in the ocean, particularly along dense maritime routes. Our combinations of Clustering, chi-square, ANOVA, and linear regression analyses revealed that areas of high shipping density are significantly more likely to exhibit higher nitrate concentrations, though the overall effect size remains modest. These findings overall suggest that areas with higher shipping density contribute to the level of nitrate which may influence the surrounding ecosystem. 

While statistically significant, the relationships identified here explain only a small fraction of nitrate variability, reflecting the complexity of ocean systems and the influence of natural processes such as currents and upwelling. The study highlights the need for more temporally and spatially resolved data to better quantify the impacts of maritime activity on nutrient levels and to connect nitrate enrichment directly to biological outcomes like phytoplankton blooms.
